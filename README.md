# Bellabeat Case Study

"Bellabeat" is a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women. I followed six steps process: ask,
prepare, process, analyze, share, and act, to break down the analysis on FitBit fitness Tracker Data in order to gain
some insights that are aimed at enhancing product performance and customer satisfaction. The project includes
work in PostgreSQL, Python and Tableau to dynamically explore, analyse and visualize the complex datasets.

Tools & technologies used: Python Data Libraries, Jupyter notebook, PostgreSQL, Tableau

### A)  BUSINESS TASK

1. **Objective**: Analyze FitBit data of 30 users to find growth opportunities and understand Bellabeat smart device usage.
  
2. **Focus**: Examine Bellabeatâ€™s membership program for personalized health guidance.
  
3. **Goals**:
   - Identify FitBit growth opportunities.
   - Understand Bellabeat device usage patterns.
   - Improve Bellabeat membership program guidance.
  
4. **Target Areas**: Nutrition, activity, sleep, health, beauty, mindfulness.
  
5. **Approach**: Collect and analyze data, pinpoint trends, refine product offerings and user experience.


### B) DATA CREDIBILITY
1. **Sample Size Adequacy**: With 33 FitBit users, surpassing the threshold of 30, insights derived can be considered robust and potentially applicable beyond the sample.
  
2. **Data Recency**: The data remains current as it falls within the past 10 years, ensuring relevance and reliability in analysis.
  
3. **Relevance to Bellabeat**: The collected data aligns with Bellabeat's product offerings, suggesting that findings from the analysis may be directly applicable to Bellabeat's products, enhancing their utility and effectiveness.
